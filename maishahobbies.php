	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			In my freetime, I enjoy reading novels, self-help books, and non-fiction books that shed light on very specific topics (e.g. rat population in New York City, processed food marketing history of the USA, growth of anti-Semitism on Twitter, etc).  I also enjoy cooking, especially Bangladeshi foods, since that’s my cultural background and what home food is for me.  In particular, I enjoy cooking for others (this is an invitation!).  I would consider myself a people person on most days, and I always enjoy meeting and getting to know new people.  In terms of non-computing languages, I am fluent in English and Bangla (westernized for Bengali).  A lifetime dream I recently completed was seeing Beyoncé live.  A remaining lifetime dream is to travel more.  Beyond that, a hobby I hope to redevelop is playing chess, while a habit I’d like to develop is going to the gym…
