	<h2>Extra-Curriculars</h2>

		<p> This past year, I started rethinking my entire major when I fell in love with programming. As a senior, all I can do now is take any class I can fit in my schedule. I am currently auditing CSC 171. I am also working on some projects in Python to improve my programming skills. Likely, I have a professor helping me out, but this is going to be a very long semester because I am more than overloading.</p>
