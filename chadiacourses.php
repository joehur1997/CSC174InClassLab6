		<p>I am currently taking a class on Financial Statement Analysis that covers the applied financial analysis and valuation skills that are required to work on Wall Street in, for example, investment banking and equity research firms. The objective of this class is to develop and sharpen one’s analytical ability to use financial information to perform a wide variety of applied economic and financial analysis. Last semester, I took Corporate Finance that I found very interesting. The course examined corporate financing policy – thus our primary focus was on the liability side of the firm’s balance sheet. We examined the valuation of debt and equity claims under the simplifying assumptions made by Modigliani and Miller. We also examined how relaxing those assumptions provides a basis for understanding financing policy choices. We looked at leverage, the use of public vs. private debts, maturity, priority, leasing, and hedging policies. Finally, we also discussed competition and dividend policies.</p>
