	<h2>Hobbies</h2>

		<p>I like to travel. I just went back from a study abroad program called Semester at Sea where we got chance to travel to 10 countries on a ship. We embarked in Germany, and visited Spain, Ghana, South Africa, Mauritius, India, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Japan, Hawaii, and disembarked in San Diego. We took courses, related to each country’s history, politics, culture, and economics, on the ship from one port to next port. When we got to each port, we did independent travelling in different cities. We visited Barcelona and Valencia in Spain; Tema, Accra, and Cape Coast in Ghana; Cape Town in South Africa; Port Louis in Mauritius; Kochi, Bengaluru and Chennai in India; Yangon, Mandalay and Bagan in Myanmar; Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), and Nha Trang in Vietnam; Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in China; Kobe, Osaka, and Kyoto in Japan; Honolulu in Hawaii. It was a three months travelling and the voyage did broaden my horizon and enrich my cross-cultural perspectives.</p>
