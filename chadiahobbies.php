	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p> I am originally from Burundi, a tiny country shaped like a heart and located at the heart of Africa. I moved to the U.S to get a good education that would be useful to bring back home. Ultimately, I would like to start my own non-profit in Burundi, one that is focused on helping women and children pull themselves out of poverty. However, building a non-profit that is self-sustainable and that lasts turned out to be harder than it looked but I am not giving up.</p>
