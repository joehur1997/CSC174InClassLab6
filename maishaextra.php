	<h2>Extra-Curriculars</h2>

		<p>
			I work part time as a Technical Assistant at the University of Rochester School of Nursing, where I provide support in IT, Facilities, and Educational Media.  Workshop leading/TAing was also a source of income in the past, though I’ve let that go for my last semester of college.  Additionally, I am a Kearns Scholar and a Hajim Scholar, two academic distinctions I’m proud of.  Extracurricular-wise, I recently finished my term as the Public Relations Chair of WiC (Women in Computing), a club I was (and still am!) extremely dedicated to.  I’ve been fortunate to do so much in WiC, including alumni video interviews in conjunction with the Office of Admissions, merchandise production, a successful #SupportWomenInCS campaign, and a burgeoning PhD-Undergraduate Computer Science program!  Along with my work in WiC, I am a co-founder of 1st Gen Society, the home for the first-generation college students at UR.
