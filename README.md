## Typography
I picked the fonts "Oswald" and "Open Sans Condensed" because they convey a sense of order and professionalism. Since the page was about academics and C.S, I thought it would fit the overall theme of the content well.

## Readability 
I changed the background color of the webpage because I found the orignal color a bit difficult to read with the black font. I also made the background color of the main content to distinguish as the primary focus and to make it even more readable. I also made most of the font sizes larger.

## Separators
I added borders to the top part and included the H2 in the main section to distinguish them from each other, and emphasize that they are separate elements.

## White Space/Density of Text/Etc...
In general, I added a bit more padding to all elements to make reading easier. There is also more space between lines of text, and more space between different parts of the site.
