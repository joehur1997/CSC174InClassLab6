	<h2>Extra-Curriculars</h2>
		<p>
			I worked at an equity research firm as a summer analyst in New York City this past summer, where I performed in-depth equity research on the industrials sector and created 10 company profiles including risk assessment and investment considerations. In addition, I built models to track historical trading performance of the 10 companies based on EV/EBITDA, P/E multiples, and conducted DCF analysis of shipping/logistics companies and projection of cash flows and calculation of WACC as well. Before that I interned at a wealth management firm in Hongkong in my sophomore summer. During my internship, I evaluated competitive landscape of the wealth management industry, focusing on the advantages of External Asset Managers (EAMs) compared to private banks and other securities firms. In addition, I contributed to the development of risk-return tradeoff recommendations and customized investment strategies for clients, with an average portfolio size exceeding HKD$50 million. In the end of my internship, I created a deck detailing tax implication of insurance and trust products which allowed clients to better plan for their investments in the context of wealth transfer and optimization of estate planning and inheritance tax.
